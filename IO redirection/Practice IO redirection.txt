Use UNIX system calls such as 'open()', 'dup()', 'close()', and 'execlp()' to implement the following shell command:  

'wc < foo.bar > result'

Explanation of the Command:

wc: A utility that counts lines, words, and characters.

< foo.bar: Redirects the standard input (stdin) to read from the file foo.bar.

> result: Redirects the standard output (stdout) to write to the file result

Use the 'script' command to demonstrate your program's source code and execution results.
